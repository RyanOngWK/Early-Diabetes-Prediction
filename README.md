## About
This is a mini project for SC1015 - Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence using the Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction dataset from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishandutta/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction-dataset].

### Problem definition
- By applying advanced predictive models, we aim to enhance diagnostic processes and contribute to better health outcomes. 

### Models Used
1. Logistical Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Multi-Layer Perception Neural Network Model

## Conclusion
- Polyuria and polydipsia have the strongest positive correlations with diabetes outcomes, suggesting they are significant indicators of diabetes.
- Itching has a near-zero correlation with diabetes.
- All three models performed at high accuracies (above 90%), the ability to predict whether patients are at risk of diabetes is possible using any of the three models but the best being random forest classifier(above 99%).

## What did we learn from this project?
- Neural network and the Pytorch framework needed to create a neural network
- Data Loader, Data Preprocessing and Early Stopping
- Logistical regression from Scikit-Learn
- Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-Learn
- Concepts about Precision, ROC, Cross Val Accuracy, Recall Score and F1 Score.
- Collaboration within Github
